🚀 Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust: 100-Day Challenge

This repository documents my journey to mastering data structures and algorithms through a structured 100-day challenge. The plan covers fundamental to advanced topics like arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more, all implemented using Rust.
🗓️ Routine Overview

    Duration: 100 Days
    Daily Commitment: 1 Hour
    Focus Areas:
        Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
        Trees, Recursion, Binary Search Trees
        Hash Maps, Stacks, Queues
        Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path, etc.)
        Dynamic Programming & Advanced Problem-Solving

📚 Goals

    Develop a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms.
    Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.
    Enhance problem-solving skills for competitive programming and technical interviews.
